CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Class (hehehehehehehe, the thing I hate the most)

- There are some tags which are used in CSS these days, but were previously used in HTML code. Some of those tags are <font>, <bold>, <alighnment>, etc. 

- It's like an unspoken rule which helps us, i.e., to keep the code which applies designs and styles to the site into the CSS file, rather than in HTML file. This helps us in keeping the same things in the same file, i.e., in CSS which helps us in organisatoion.

- NOTE - To use CSS, we WILL need the HTML file! 

WHAT IS CSS?

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

NOTE - We can write multiple CSS files which will add the style element to different things. All such styling elements in various CSS files are merged into one and then rendered into the website as one.

WHY USE CSS?
- CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. 
	- HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
		<h1>This is a heading</h1>
		<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

		When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
	- To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
	- CSS Saves a Lot of Work! The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files. With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

HOW TO ADD CSS?
- When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.
- There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
	- External CSS
	- Internal CSS
	- Inline CSS

- INTERNAL CSS 
	- An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

	- Example - Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	<style>
	body {
  		background-color: linen;
	}

	h1 {
  		color: maroon;
  		margin-left: 40px;
	}
	</style>
	</head>
	<body>

	<h1>This is a heading</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

	</body>
	</html>

- INLINE CSS
	- An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
	- Example - Inline styles are defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<body>

	<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
	<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

	</body>
	</html>

- EXTERNAL CSS
	- With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
	- Example - External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page. This <link> tag helps us link the CSS file with the HTML file. The "rel" attribute in <link> tag defines the relationship between the HTML file and the file to be linked. Then, we use the "href" attribute to mention the location and name of the CSS file. The example is shown below:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
	</head>
	<body>

	<h1>This is a heading</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

	</body>
	</html>

	- An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension. The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags. Here is how the "mystyle.css" file looks:

		"mystyle.css"
			body {
  			background-color: lightblue;
			}

			h1 {
  			color: navy;
  			margin-left: 20px;
			}

- NOTE - If we write multiple CSS elements, in case of internal and external CSS, the CSS which is mentioned later on will overwrite the previous one. But, the inline CSS has higher priority. The priority order is mentioned below:
	Inline > Internal = External (Based on which is mentioned later. The latter one will overwrite the previous design) > No stylesheet (or browser default).
